# Human Color Vision Basics

Human vision is a topic many people spend a lifetime studying. Since we just need to cover the
basics for our purposes, we will vastly over-simplify things, and skip all kinds of stuff, and
likely even get some things wrong. Apologies to all those people, and please let us know if we
should fix anything.

## Cones

First, what is color? Essentially it's the way our eyes and brains interpret different wavelengths
of light. So for example, we perceive light with a wavelength of about 700 nanometers (nm) as "red".
This is because in a typical human eye there are something called "cones", and there are three types
of them: Short, Medium, and Long (referring to the length of light waves they are most sensitive
to). These S/M/L cones roughly correspond to what we think of as the colors Blue, Green, and Red (we
are "tri-chromatic", we see three colors and their combinations). So going back to the 700 nm
example, that is about the longest wavelength of light we can perceive: our long cones detect this,
and our brains interpret it as the color red.

Each cone has different sensitivities to different wavelengths, and there is some overlap, so it's
not as simple as Short=Blue, Medium=Green, and Long=Red. In reality it looks something like this:

Believe it or not, even that diagram is oversimplified. Regardless, to make it even easier for
ourselves, we often think about the cones as approximately SML=BGR.

## CIE 1931

In 1931 an organization known as CIE used some measurements taken from experiments conducted in the
1920s to standardize what we know know as the CIE 1931 color space. By testing the response of our
eyes to different colors, these measurements allowed people to construct a mathematical model for
our perception of color.
